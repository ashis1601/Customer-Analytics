## [Product Mix Optimization](https://github.com/ashis1601/Customer-Analytics/blob/main/Product%20Mix%20Optimization/Product-Mix-Optimization.ipynb)

Conducting a comprehensive analysis of market trends, we engage in the process of ideating and developing a range of diverse products. Our aim is to discern the optimal product that aligns perfectly with our target segment. This involves assessing various criteria, including the product's potential for gaining the highest market share, its expected profitability per individual, the efficiency of production costs, revenue generation potential, and the capacity for achieving the highest profit margin. By carefully considering these factors, we can identify the product that offers the most advantageous fit for our target market.
